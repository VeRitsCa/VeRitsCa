- 👋 Hi, I’m @VeRitsCa
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code. Just taking a class now this Fall 2022, but I'm kind of slow...
- 🌱 I’m currently waiting for my appointment with the faculty for recommendations. Just the absolute basics for now
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I find interesting, but I'm so new that I don't know what there is out there to collaborate on.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
