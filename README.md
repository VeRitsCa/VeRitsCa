- 👋 Hi, I’m @VeRitsCa
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code. Just taking a class this Fall 2024, but I'm kind of slow...maybe because I'm kinda old-er!
- 🌱 I’m currently waiting for my appointment with the faculty for recommendations. Just the absolute basics for this old gal!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I find interesting, but I'm so new that I don't know what there is out there to collaborate on.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
